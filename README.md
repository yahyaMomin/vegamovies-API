# Vegamovies API  

This is an unofficial web scraping API for Vegamovies, built using Node.js and Fastify. It fetches movie and TV show data in real-time and returns it in JSON format.  

## ‚ùó Project Status  

I have stopped working on this project because I couldn't successfully bypass Cloudflare protection during deployment. However, I did manage to bypass it locally, and the API works fine on a local machine.  

The main issue is **deployment**‚Äîif you know how to deploy this API on a free platform like Vercel or Render, feel free to contribute!  

## üîß Tech Stack  

- **Node.js** (Fastify)  
- **Axios** (for fetching data)  
- **Cheerio** (for HTML parsing)
